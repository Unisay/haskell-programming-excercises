module Recursion where

{-
Write a function that recursively sums all numbers from 1 to n,
n being the argument. So that if n was 5, youâ€™d add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
5 to get 15. The type should be (Eq a, Num a) => a -> a.

sumit n = go n 0
  where go num acc
         | num <= 0 = acc
         | otherwise = go (num - 1) (acc + num)

{-
Write a function that multiplies two integral numbers using
recursive summation. The type should be (Integral a) => a ->
a -> a.
